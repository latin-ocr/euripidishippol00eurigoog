INTRODUCTION.

Purernen,¹ the wife ol Theseus, King os Athens, became

· enamoured of Hippolytus, his son by a former marriage. She

had first seen him at Athens, on me occasion of his visit to
the Eleusinion mysteries (lines 24-28), and again met with
him at Troezene-while sharing her husband's exile in that
, place (lines 34-37), -where he was being brought up
under the care of Pittheus. She concealed the secret for a
long time, but at last disclosed it to her nurse, whom turn

⁵ revealed it to Hippolytus himself. Phaedra, hearing of the
disclosure of her love to him, and os the anger he manifested
at the news, hangs herself, but, by way of avenging her
unrequited love, leavesa letter behind, 1n which she accuses
Hippolytus of having attempted her honour. Theseus now

returns to Troezene, whence he had been for some time
absent, and becomes acquainted with the contents of the
letter. In the moment of passion, he pronounces a sentence
ol exile against Hippolytus, and invokes a curse upon him
which is fulfilled by his death through the agency of Poseidon,
as described in ὼε play. Τὴε goddess Artemis then appears
and informs Theseus of the real state of the case, and a
reconciliation takes place between the father and the dying
son, to whom Artemis promises immortal honours in the
shape of a feast to be held in Troezene iii remembrance os

him lor ever.
