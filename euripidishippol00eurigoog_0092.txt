10 THE HIPPOLYYUS. [373-421

Pnsrn Ο women of Troezene, who inhabit this furt hest
vestibulo οι the land of Pelops, already' ιιι the long time of night .
hare I speculated ut randum ιιι what way the life οι mortels'
is ruined3 and they seem ιο me ιο fare worse not by reason
οι the nature οι their judgment, tfor many have good sense,
but we must tconsider this ιιι- the-following wey3 we know und
,feel whut' rs good, but we do not praet ιιοιι, some οι us from
idlencss, and others through preferring some other pleasnre ιο ·
thet which rs honourable. And there are many pleesures ο1
life, both long conversations and leisure, epleasant evil, end
shrine3 and there are two (sorte bf adde), the one nod bad,
but‘t‘de other the sorrow οι houses3 and f the proper time
were clear, there would not be two having the same letters ,

τ’ [since thcn I huppen ιο heve decidcd this beforehand, there ιι
no dmg by which Ι was likely to forget, so as tolose my

from this time Ι began ιο keep silence aud conceal this disense
For Ι have no reliance on a tonguffhichf knows how ιο advisa

s the thoughts οι strengerS, while itselfo fitself it posesscs the
greatest evils. And' ιιι the second νριοοι-ιι took thought ιο bear
my fclly well by conquering ιι by self -control And thirdly, ·
when I was unable ιο ovcrcomc Venus byrm‘s'e smeans, it tseemed
tome best to die: no one will geinsey my plens. For may it , ·
be mine neither to bc unncticed when doing good, nor to have
many wi tnesses when doing what' rs wrong, But Ι knew the ·

ιιιιοιι well that Ι was c woincn, an object οι hate ιο all. So
may she perish all-wretchcdly whoever was the first that began
to disgrace her marriage—bed with strangers. And from noble ’
houses it was that this evil began ιο arise for women. For

’ when disgraoeful deeds seem good to the rich ,ussuredly ιο the
poor they will seem to bc good. And I hate women who ere
temperate in word, but' ιιι secret possess impious boldness. How,
Omistress Venus οι the sea, how ever do they (ιιι. tube, how
do they) look et the faces οι their husbends, and do not shudder
at darkness their accomplice and the chambers οι the house· .
