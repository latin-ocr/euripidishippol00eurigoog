Foolish then uas Ι, nay rather nowhere in my censes. But
(you may answer) that even to the discreet sowereignty is

senses ol those men whom it pleases. But I would wish to
conquer in the Hellenic gemes as first, and in the state to live
ε happily holding the second place with the best friends. For
it is both possible to manage affaire, end danger being absent
produces pleesure greater than sovereignty. But one thing of
