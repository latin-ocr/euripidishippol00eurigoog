ii INTRODUCTION.

From the Greek argument prefixed to this play we

leam that it was produced in 429, nc. (ὀλυμπιάδι ὀγδοηκοστῇ ¹

ἕβδόμῃ ἔτει τετάρτῳ ie. Ol. 87, 4.) Euripides gaining the

· first prize with it Itis a second, and apparently improved

edition (τὸ γάρ ἀπρεπὲς καὶ κατηγορίας ἄξιον ἐν τούτῳ διόρθωται
τῷ δράματι). It is called Στιφιινὴφιροι (ie. bearinggarlands)

in reference to line 73, to distinguish it from the earlier play ¹
’ which was called Καλιιιτόμιιοι, owing to the sact that

Hippolytus was brought on the stage dead and wrapped up.
The scene of the play is at Troezene, in Argolis in the N. E.
of the Peloponnese.

The play has been adapted to the modern stage by
Racine inhis Phedre. Ι

The text adopted is that of Dindorf's Poetae Scenici
Graeci (5th. Edition 1868). ’

Ihave endeavoured to make the Translation as literni
as possible, while in the notes I have explained the meaning
where such closeness of rendering seemed in any way to
obscure the sense. Ι have of course to acknowledge assis
tance in various places from Mr. Paley's Edition of the play in
the Bibliotheca Classica„ the notes of Monlr‚ Valkenaer‚ and

· the Scholia.
