„s sending forth from its crags a flowing stream, that may be ·
drawn in pitchers, where there was a certain friend of mine,
washing purple robes in river water, and she kept spreading·

me, first came the repert that ber mistress,[wcrn-edt⁴by-siclrness

My heart longs to leam what it is, what bath injured the
changed appearance of the queen. ‘
