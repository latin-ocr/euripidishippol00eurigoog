vsa-832] THE HIPPOLYTUS. 19

Caenus. The unhappy woman, as Ι hear, bath perished. ’

For already even now they are laying her out aa dead.

Tarsum. Ladios, know ye what cry is in the house? the
heavy wail of the attendants hath reached me. For the house
does not think fit to open the gater and address me joyfully
as a sacred-envoy. The aged Pittheus hath suffered no herm?
his life is far advanued, but nevcrtheless it would still grieve
us if he left (lit. he would grievously leave) this house.

Osopus. This lot has no reference to the aged for thee,
Ο Theseus; the young by their death will grieve thee.

Trrns. Ales! is the life of my children taken awayl ⁴

Ononus. They live; their mother has died in a manner
most painful for thee. ’

Tuas. What sayest thou? is my wife dead? by what hapl
’ Caenus. She fastened on herself the suspended halter-noose.

Tuus. Ohilled by grief, or from what calamity? s

Cuonus. Thus much we know3 forI was just now at the*
house, Ο Theseus, a monmer for thy misfortunes.

r Tuus. Alas! why then am Iorowned as to my head with
these woven chapletS, being an unlucky envoy? open the bolts
of the gates, Ο attendants, undo the fastenings, that I may

' sestha bitter'sight of the woman, who heth destroyed-me hy

her death.

Onoraea. Alsaalas, woe is me for thy wretched sufferings!
'. thou hast suffered, thou hest wrought enough to confound this
’ house. Alas‘, for thy during-O thou¹ that hast died by a

· violent and unholy calamity, a struggle of thy unhappy haud.

Who is it, unhappy woman, that darkens thy liter ’
’ Tuus. Woe is me for my sorrowsl Ihave suffered, un-
happy man that I am, the greatest of my woes. Ο fortune, how
heavily hast thou visited me and my house, an unspeakable hlot
from some avenging spirit. Nay rather a destruction of¹ life that
cannot be survived; and I behold a sea 'of evils so great that
· I can never swim out again, nor escape the ware of this
calamity. What words (shall I he right in speaking), what
¹shall Ι b'e right in calling thy grievous lot, Ο lady? For like
abird out of the hand art thou gone, having sped with a swift
. leap to Hades. Alae! wretched, wretched are these sufferings.
But'from som'e distant source Ι bring upon myself divine fat'e

(lit. fate sent hy, or of, the gods) by the sins of some one of
those before me. '
